The gun may have some problem to fit the hands (on rotation). On my device it's fully working (meta quest 3) but on a friends device (meta quest 2) the gun seems to not be in the right angle.
Click on the grip to take the gun in your hands after it is in your hands you can shoot while pressing the trigger. 
To take object in the area (except gun) just hold the grip button.
